# turbo-spork
Function to generate a jpeg image consisting of multiple other images. Presently, it creates rows and columns. Also only works with jpg images for now.

If you're interested in this project, please bear with me for the next few days as I prepare the code for up;oading. 
I know, I know, I kinda jumped the gun creating the repository and the code not ready. Sue me.
